# Problem Definition

This project seeks to delve into the NYC Department of Finance's parking violation data over the past 3 years, aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of parking infractions in New York City. By doing so, we intend to provide valuable insights for policymakers and citizens alike.

The significance of addressing parking violations lies in its impact on urban mobility and the daily lives of citizens. Illegitimate parking can contribute to traffic congestion, safety concerns, and inconvenience for residents. Therefore, our research seeks to shed light on the patterns and factors contributing to parking violations, with the ultimate goal of informing effective policies and practices to enhance urban parking efficiency, making New York City a more livable and navigable space for everyone.

Further, combining with information from the violation detail dataset, and the weather data, we dive into the connections of parking violations, fine amount and weather data.

Our primary objectives include:

* Investigating the seasonality of parking violations to pinpoint periods of heightened violation activity.
* Examining vehicle attributes (make, year, body type) to uncover correlations with a higher likelihood of receiving parking tickets.
* Exploring the relationships between violation types and issuers, times, and vehicle characteristics.
* Investigating potential root causes of parking violations through analysing distribution pattern of violation codes as well as it's relationship with fine amount.
* Discover patterns in violation fine amount and relation to weather in New York City.

# Summary
From our analysis of parking ticket violations in New York City from 2021 to 2023, several key insights are highlighted: there are consistent trends and notable peaks during summer months, particularly August 2022. Monthly data shows an end-of-month surge in violations, while daily trends pinpoint 8 AM as a peak hour for ticketing, aligning with rush hour. "PHTO SCHOOL ZN SPEED VIOLATION" emerges as a frequent infraction, indicating the need for active speed enforcement in school zones. An analysis of vehicle-related data reveals that common vehicle colors, white, grey, and black and popular makes like Honda and Toyota are most ticketed, with newer vehicles more likely to receive tickets. Agency 'T' leads in ticket issuance, and vehicles from neighboring states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, contribute significantly to NYC violations. The analysis also distinguishes between weekday and weekend patterns, emphasizing school zone speeding during weekdays. In relations with weather, the clear days experienced higher frequencies. The findings provide critical insights for developing targeted enforcement and public awareness campaigns to address traffic violations and enhance road safety in NYC, therefore supports policy decisions aimed at improving urban mobility and the quality of life for city residents by examining the intricate relationship between parking violations, enforcement practices, and external factors such as weather.
